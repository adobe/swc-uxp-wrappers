# swc-integration

This project shows a use of the `spectrum-web-components` package with webpack.

# Usage

First install with `npm run install` or `yarn install` then start the build and run the web server with `npm run serve`. This will build the production version of the example app and serve it via `http-server`. Inspect the webpack bundle report in the `report` folder to see the resultant bundle sizes.
To generate dist output folder run `yarn build`
